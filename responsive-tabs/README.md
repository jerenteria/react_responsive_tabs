# Hello and welcome to my practice project!

I created this project to help me practice a new key feature I learned. And that is how to create responsive tabs in React!  
Gaining this new ability will help me improve my front end skills by allowing me create new React apps that look a lot  
more modern. I will be able to render more information on the users screen while taking up less veritcal space.

I learned this from a Udemy course I am taking on my own time since I am always trying to improve my skills as a developer.  
Feel free to check out more of my projects because I am always working on something new!
