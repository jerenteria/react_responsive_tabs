            <p>Thank you for checking out my practice site. I saw this online and I had to try and implement this my self in order for me 
                to fully understand how this works! Now that I am able to do this I will be implementing these reactive tabs on future websites. 
                Stay tuned for other apps that I will be building in the near future! Make sure to checkout my GitHub!
